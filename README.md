# Group 41's INL 340 Assignment 2 Repository

**Welcome to our unique journey through audio interviews, digital collections, and creativity!**

## üéôÔ∏è Part 1: The Island Chronicles

In the spirit of exploration and getting to know our group, we decided to embark on a unique journey. We recorded an audio clip where we interviewed each other. This audio clip is not just a simple interview; it's an opportunity to get to know each of us better. In this 15-20 minute audio adventure, we:

- Share stories about our lives, experiences, and dreams.
- Dive deep into our favorite songs and explain why we would take them if stranded on an island.
- Each member selects one book that holds a special place in their hearts, and they reveal why.
- Discover our personal luxury items and the reasons they are essentials for our survival on the hypothetical island.

You'll find our island chronicles audio under the ["Interview" section](https://github.com/19114380/Group-41-INL340/tree/main).

## üéß Part 1: Soundtrack of Our Lives

Under the ["Audio" section](https://github.com/19114380/Group-41-INL340/tree/main/Audio), you'll discover the heart and soul of each group member through their selection of eight to twelve favorite songs. We've explained why these songs resonate with us and why they'd accompany us on that desert island.

**Note**: If you can't find some audio clips due to copyright reasons, we've included links to them.

## üñºÔ∏è Part 2: The Digital Collection

In the heart of this repository lies our digital collection, a creative endeavor that's both personal and expressive. We've brought together various digital items that represent our journeys, aspirations, and passions. Our digital collection includes:
